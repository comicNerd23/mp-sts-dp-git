 * Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they canâ€™t do. Large interfaces should be divided into small ones.
 * 
 * Consider we add decoding feature to the PasswordHasher interface since a hasher can also have functionality to decode
 * Password from hash.
 * However, it would break this principle since if some class just wants to have the hashPassword functionality, they would
 * unnecessarily need to implement this extra method as well. Furthermore, some hashing algorithms like SHA256 is not
 * decryptable.
 * Instead, we can add another interface to the applicable classes to implement their decoding algorithm.
