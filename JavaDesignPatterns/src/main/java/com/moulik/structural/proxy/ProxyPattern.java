 * A proxy can be used in many ways. 
 * 	It can act as a local representative for an object in a remote address space. 
 * 	It can represent a large object that should be loaded on demand and avoids duplication of the same object. 
 * 	Without the concept of proxies, an application could be slow, and appear non-responsive. The proxy might protect access
 *  to a sensitive object.
