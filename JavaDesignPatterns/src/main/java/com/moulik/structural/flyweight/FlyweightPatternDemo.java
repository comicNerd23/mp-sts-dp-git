/**
 * A Flyweight Pattern says that just "to reuse already existing similar kind of objects by storing them and create new object when no matching object is found".
 * 
 * Advantages:
 * 	It reduces the number of objects.
 * 	It reduces the amount of memory and storage devices required if the objects are persisted.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * 	When an application uses number of objects
 * 	When the storage cost is high because of the quantity of objects.
 * 	When the application does not depend on object identity.
 *	It is used in Java String Pool to store strings in heap memory.
