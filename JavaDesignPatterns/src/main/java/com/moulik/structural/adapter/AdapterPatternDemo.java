/**
 * An Adapter Pattern says that just "converts the interface of a class into another interface that a client wants"
 * 
 * Advantages:
 * 	It allows two or more previously incompatible objects to interact.
 * 	It allows reusability of existing functionality.
 *
 * Uses:
 * 	When an object needs to utilize an existing class with an incompatible interface.
 * 	When you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with classes which don't have compatible interfaces.
